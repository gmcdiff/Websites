                boat cruise on Lake Lucerne to admire the stunning scenery. In the afternoon, embark on an unforgettable
                journey to Mount Pilatus via the world's steepest cogwheel railway or cable car. Enjoy panoramic views
                from the summit and indulge in Swiss cuisine at one of the mountain restaurants.<br><br>

                Day 3: Scenic Train Ride to Zermatt<br>
